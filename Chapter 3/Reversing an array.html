	<h1>Reversing an array</h1>

	<p>
		<b>Challenge:</b> Arrays have a method reverse, which changes the array
		by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise,
		write two functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. The first,
		reverseArray, takes an array as argument and produces a new array that
		has the same elements in the inverse order. The second,
		reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: it modifies the
		array given as argument in order to reverse its elements. Neither may use
		the standard reverse method.
