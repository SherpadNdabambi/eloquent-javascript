	<h1>Deep comparison Exercise</h1>

	<h2>Challenge</h2>

	<p>
		The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes, you would
		prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.
	</p>

	<p>
		Write a function, deepEqual, that takes two values and returns true only
		if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties whose
		values are also equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.
	</p>

	<p>
		To find out whether to compare two things by identity (use the ===
		operator for that) or by looking at their properties, you can use the
		typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a
		deep comparison. But you have to take one silly exception into account:
		by a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".
	</p>
