  <p>
    Arrays also come with the standard methods every and some. Both take a
    predicate function that, when called with an array element as argument,
    returns true or false. Just like && returns a true value only when the
    expressions on both sides are true, every returns true only when the
    predicate returns true for all elements of the array. Similarly, some
    returns true as soon as the predicate returns true for any of the elements.
    They do not process more elements than necessaryâ€”for example, if some finds
    that the predicate holds for the first element of the array, it will not
    look at the values after that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Write two functions, every and some, that behave like these methods, except
    that they take the array as their first argument rather than being a method.
