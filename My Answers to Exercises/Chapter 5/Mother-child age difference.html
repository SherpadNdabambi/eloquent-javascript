  <h2>Challenge</h2>

  <p>
    Using the example data set from this chapter, compute the average age
    difference between mothers and children (the age of the mother when the
    child is born). You can use the average function defined earlier in this
    chapter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that not all the mothers mentioned in the data are themselves present
    in the array. The byName object, which makes it easy to find a personâ€™s
    object from their name, might be useful here.
