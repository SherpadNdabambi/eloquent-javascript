  <h1>The sum of a range</h1>

  <p>
    <b>Challenge:</b> Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and
    end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and
    including) end. Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers
    and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the previous program and see
    whether it does indeed return 55. As a bonus assignment, modify your range
    function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value
    used to build up the array. If no step is given, the array elements go up by
    increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call
    range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with
    negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].
