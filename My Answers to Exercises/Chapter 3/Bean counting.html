  <h1>Bean counting Exercise</h1>

  <p>
    <b>Challenge:</b> Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only
    argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B”
    characters are in the string. Next, write a function called countChar that
    behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the
    character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B”
    characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
