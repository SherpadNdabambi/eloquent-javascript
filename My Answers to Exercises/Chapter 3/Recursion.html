  <h1>Recursion Exercise</h1>

  <p>
    <b>Challenge:</b> We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to
    test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to check whether it’s
    divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole
    number is even or odd:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Zero is even.</li>
    <li>One is odd.</li>
    <li>For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The
    function should accept a number parameter and return a Boolean. Test it on
    50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix
    this?
