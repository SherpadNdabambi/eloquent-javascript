	<h1>Recursive Puzzle</h1>

	<p>
		<b>Challenge:</b> By starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either
		adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite amount of new numbers can be
		produced. How would you write a function that, given a number, tries to
		find a sequence of such additions and multiplications that produce that
		number? For example, the number 13 could be reached by first multiplying
		by 3 and then adding 5 twice, whereas the number 15 cannot be reached at
		all.
