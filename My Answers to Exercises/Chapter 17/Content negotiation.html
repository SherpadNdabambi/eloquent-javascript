	<h2>Challenge</h2>

	<p>
		One of the things that HTTP can do, but that we have not discussed in this
chapter, is called content negotiation. The <code>Accept</code> header for a request can be
used to tell the server what type of document the client would like to get. Many
servers ignore this header, but when a server knows of various ways to encode
a resource, it can look at this header and send the one that the client prefers.
	</p>
	<p>
		The URL <a href="eloquentjavascript.net/author">eloquentjavascript.net/author</a> is configured to respond with either
plaintext, HTML, or JSON, depending on what the client asks for. These
formats are identified by the standardized <i>media types</i> <code>text/plain</code>, <code>text/html</code>, and
<code>application/json</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Send requests to fetch all three formats of this resource. Use the <code>setRequestHeader</code>
method of your <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object to set the header named <code>Accept</code> to one of
the media types given earlier. Make sure you set the header <i>after</i> calling open
but before calling <code>send</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, try asking for the media type <code>application/rainbows+unicorns</code> and see
what happens.
