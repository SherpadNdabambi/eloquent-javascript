  <h2>Challenge</h2>

  <p>
    The Promise constructor has an all method that, given an array of promises,
    returns a promise that waits for all of the promises in the array to finish.
    It then succeeds, yielding an array of result values. If any of the promises
    in the array fail, the promise returned by all fails too (with the failure
    value from the failing promise).
  </p>
  <p>
    Try to implement something like this yourself as a regular function called
    all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that after a promise is resolved (has succeeded or failed), it canâ€™t
    succeed or fail again, and further calls to the functions that resolve it
    are ignored. This can simplify the way you handle failure of your promise.
